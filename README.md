# CSCI430-E-Commerce
This was a project for my CSCI 430 (Object-Oriented Software Development) Course at SCSU.
A team of 3 (including me) worked on this project to implement a simple E-Commerce site using Java.
We each were tasked in creating 4 main parts of the project, which were; The Client, The Supplier, The Products, and the UI.
I was tasked with creating the Client and Transactions between the system and the clients.
We all shared the work to integrate our classes with the UI and the Facade.
The project utilized the Facade pattern to combine and abstract all the individual classes that were created.
